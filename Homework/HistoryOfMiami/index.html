                    <p>
                        European explorer Ponce De Leon sailed across the sea in search of the fountain of wealth. When his ships sailed into Biscayne Bay and landed on the South Florida coast in 1513, the explorers soon realized the area was inhabited by the Tequesta, a peaceful Native American tribe. The tribe called the area by the name “Mayaimi”, meaning a big lake. Ponce De Leon claimed this huge portion of Southeast Florida, including present-day Miami, for his country of Spain.

                    <p>
                        In 1821, during the Seminole Indian Wars that concluded in the year 1858, The United States bought Florida from Spain for $5 Million. By this time, most of the Tequestas had already migrated out of Florida.

                    <p>
                        The modern history of Miami began in 1894, when Julia Tuttle, a local landowner, convinced the railroad-tycoon Henry Flagler to expand the Florida East Coast Railway towards Miami. The railroad was completed and on July 28, 1896, the city of Miami was officially established with a population of only 300 residents.

                    <p>When the 1920’s began, Miami was thriving. This was reversed when the real estate bubble burst occurred in 1925. At that point came the 1926 Miami Hurricane, followed shortly after by the 1930s Great Depression. </p>

                    <p>When Fidel Castro took control of Cuba in 1959, a great deal of Cubans relocated to Miami, further expanding the populace by almost double of which it was. Most of the exiles settled into the Riverside neighborhood, which began to take on the new name of "Little Havana".</p>

                    <h1> The 20th Century</h1>
                    <p>In the 1980s, Miami became one of the United States' largest transshipment point for cocaine from Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. The drug industry brought billions of dollars into Miami, which were quickly funneled through front organizations into the local economy. Luxury car dealerships, five-star hotels, condominium developments, swanky nightclubs, major commercial developments and other signs of prosperity began rising all over the city. As the money arrived, so did a violent crime wave that lasted through the early 1990s. The popular television program Miami Vice, which dealt with counter-narcotics agents in an idyllic upper-class rendition of Miami, spread the city's image as one of America's most glamorous subtropical paradises.

                    <p>Miami Beach is everything you've heard about, but you have to see it for yourself. Take an Art Deco tour of Miami Beach to fully appreciate the area's signature architecture. The South Beach Art Deco District is a whimsical collection of more than 800 architecturally protected buildings in Miami Beach from the 1930s and 1940s – a definite must-see. Stay in one of its boutique or throwback hotels – you'll also find some of Miami Beach's finest dining, nightlife and spas here. North Beach's Ocean Terrace is fast becoming a smaller version of South Beach, with inviting oceanfront hotels and cafés. Regardless, be sure to go for a beachside stroll or to Haulover Park for fishing, bike rides, tennis or golf. And, of course, Miami Beach’s nightlife always concludes an unforgettable vacation day.</p>
