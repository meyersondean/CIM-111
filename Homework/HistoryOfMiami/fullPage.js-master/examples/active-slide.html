                    <p>
                        About thousands of years ago before the Europeans made their way to this place, a huge portion of South East Florida where the Miami and Florida areas exist today, was home to Tequestas. The Tequestas were a Native American tribe who occupied the area until the first encounter with the Europeans. The area they occupied was along Southeastern Atlantic Ocean of Florida. The contact with Europeans was infrequent and by the 18th century most of them had migrated.

                        Pedro Menendez De Aviles arrived here on the orders of the Spanish monarchy in 1566 to get rid of the French that inhabited Florida. They had already constructed several colonies here. During this time Menendez left at least two Jesuit missionaries to convert the native tribes to Roman Catholicism, but the tribe stood true to their teachings and defied the new religion. Soon after these, the Jesuits returned to their origin place after spending at least a year there. In 1836, Fort Dallas was established which functioned as a military base in the second Seminole war.

                        Before the Miami area grew, it was known as the Biscayne Bay Country. A few records from the past reveal that this area was mostly a wilderness that was brimming with a promise of a bright future. It was later deemed as one of the best areas for the building sites in Florida. In 1984, after the Great Freeze, the crops in area were the only ones that survived in the whole of Florida. At this time, a local landowner by the name Julia Tuttle took it upon herself to convince Henry Flagler, a railroad tycoon to expand the Florida East Coast Railway towards Miami. Miami was officially incorporated on July 28, 1896 having a population of only 300 residents.

                    <p>During the 1920s, Miami saw much prosperity. But this was reversed during the real estate bubble burst that happened in 1925. Then came the 1926 Miami Hurricane followed by the 1930s Great Depression. When the great World War II started, Miami played a key role during the battle against German submarines. Its location on the southern coast of Florida made this possible. After the war had ended, Miami saw exceptional growth in its population which neared almost half a million. </p>

                    <h1> The 20th Century</h1>
                    <p>Following the 1959 Cuban revolution that unseated Fulgencio Batista and brought Fidel Castro to power, most Cubans who were living in Miami returned to Cuba. Soon after, however, many middle class and upper class Cubans moved to Florida en masse with few possessions. Many of Miami's Cuban refugees realized for the first time that it would be a long time before they would get back to Cuba.In 1965 alone, 100,000 Cubans packed into the twice daily "freedom flights" from Havana to Miami. Most of the exiles settled into the Riverside neighborhood, which began to take on the new name of "Little Havana".</p>

                    <h1> The 20th Century</h1>
                    <p>In the 1980s, Miami became one of the United States' largest transshipment point for cocaine from Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. The drug industry brought billions of dollars into Miami, which were quickly funneled through front organizations into the local economy. Luxury car dealerships, five-star hotels, condominium developments, swanky nightclubs, major commercial developments and other signs of prosperity began rising all over the city. As the money arrived, so did a violent crime wave that lasted through the early 1990s. The popular television program Miami Vice, which dealt with counter-narcotics agents in an idyllic upper-class rendition of Miami, spread the city's image as one of America's most glamorous subtropical paradises.

                    <p>The Mariel Boatlift of 1980 brought 150,000 Cubans to Miami, the largest transport in civilian history. Unlike the previous exodus of the 1960s, most of the Cuban refugees arriving were poor, some having been released from prisons or mental institutions to make the trip. During this time, many of the middle class non-Hispanic whites in the community left the city, often referred to as the "white flight". In 1960, Miami was 90% non-Hispanic white, but by 1990, it was only about 10% non-Hispanic white.In the 1980s, Miami started to see an increase in immigrants from other nations, such as Haiti. As the Haitian population grew in Miami, the area known today as "Little Haiti" emerged, centered on Northeast Second Avenue and 54th Street.

                    <p>Miami Beach is everything you've heard about, but you have to see it for yourself. Take an Art Deco tour of Miami Beach to fully appreciate the area's signature architecture. The South Beach Art Deco District is a whimsical collection of more than 800 architecturally protected buildings in Miami Beach from the 1930s and 1940s – a definite must-see. Stay in one of its boutique or throwback hotels – you'll also find some of Miami Beach's finest dining, nightlife and spas here. North Beach's Ocean Terrace is fast becoming a smaller version of South Beach, with inviting oceanfront hotels and cafés. Regardless, be sure to go for a beachside stroll or to Haulover Park for fishing, bike rides, tennis or golf. And, of course, Miami Beach’s nightlife always concludes an unforgettable vacation day.</p>
