            <p>The adidas Yeezy line is a line of footwear created by Kanye West and adidas. After leaving a contract with Nike in 2013, West then partnered with adidas and released his first shoe — the adidas Yeezy Boost 750 — in February of 2015, followed by the original adidas Yeezy 350 in June of 2015. Quickly becoming one of the most desired lines on the market thanks to its limited quantities and West’s A-list celebrity status, the line then expanded with models like the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 in 2016, the Yeezy Boost 700 in 2017, and the Yeezy 500 in 2018
            The latest adidas Yeezy releases of 2019 were on March 16th, when the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 dropped in a “TRUEFORM” and “Hyperspace" colorways for $220 USD. They will be followed by the Yeezy Boost 700 V2 “Geode” on March 23rd for $300 USD and the Yeezy Boost 350 V2 “Clay” dropping in the United States on March 30th.

            <p>The adidas NMD R1 “OG” kicked things off in the simplest way possible for the NMD series. The black on black Primeknit nearly camouflages the three stripes side panel branding while international ‘The Brand With The Three Stripes’ branding arrived on the heel tab for a unique twist. The influences of the Micro Pacer, Boston Super, and Rising Star can be found throughout, especially on the midsole’s unique ‘bumpers’ in Lush Red and Royal Blue.

        <p>Travis Scott recently got his very own “Cactus Jack” Jordan Trunner LX, and now it looks like he’s partnered with Nike Sportswear for an Air Force 1 Low, as well. Just like Scott himself, this will be no ordinary edition of the Air Force 1, as it features a velcro upper that customizable with various options for the Swooshes in metallic, graphic, and prismatic finishes. They also feature a detachable Cactus Jack records logo patch that buttons onto the tongue over the laces.

        <p>Nike’s inaugural Vote Forward campaign winner Sean Wotherspoon recently took to his personal Instagram to confirm some big news for Air Max fans. It appears that a sequel to his highly popular Air Max 1/97 is indeed in the works, and the samples that he revealed suggest a colorway that might be a little more toned than from the original version. The unofficial nickname of “Second Wave” could point to a color composition that is anchored in a blue palette, although it remains to be seen what changes Sean decides on for the final version. There’s no question that another collaborative release with the Round Two founder will move mountains, so stay tuned.

          Puma SE, branded as Puma, is a German multinational company that designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories, which is headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. PUMA is the third largest sportswear manufacturer in the world.[4] The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler. In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory). The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until the two agreed to split in 1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma. Both companies are currently based in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
